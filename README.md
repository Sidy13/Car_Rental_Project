Car Rental Project

Overview

The Car Rental Project is a system designed to manage car rentals efficiently. It includes features for managing customers, employees, and vehicles, along with functionalities for handling reservations and payments.
It is made for an employee behind his computer in his office not to allow a customer to rent a car by himself.

UML usage

This project was made during my "Oriented Object Programming using UML" class so I had to do some of them which are available in a png format.
